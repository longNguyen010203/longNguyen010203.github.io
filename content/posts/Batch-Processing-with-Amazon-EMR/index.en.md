üë∑ Set up and build a large data processing system with Amazon EMR using Apache Spark and some other services such as Amazon S3, VPC, EC2 on üì¶ Amazon Web Services (AWS)

<!--more-->

## 1. üåç Introduction
Since launching in 2006, Amazon Web Services has been providing world-leading cloud technologies that help any organization and any individual build solutions to transform industries, communities, and lives for the better.

As part of [Amazon](https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us), we strive to be Earth‚Äôs most customer-centric company. We work backwards from our customers‚Äô problems to provide them with cloud infrastructure that meets their needs, so they can reinvent continuously and push through barriers of what people thought was possible.

Whether they are entrepreneurs launching new businesses, established companies reinventing themselves, non-profits working to advance their missions, or governments and cities seeking to serve their citizens more effectively‚Äîour customers trust AWS with their livelihoods, their goals, their ideas, and their data.

### 1.1. Amazon VPC
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) is a **Virtual Private Cloud**‚Äîa customized virtual network hosted within the AWS Cloud and isolated from the external world. This concept resembles the design and implementation of a distinct standalone network environment in an on-premise data center, a practice still widely employed across many countries.

Within this dedicated VPC, users possess comprehensive control over their virtual network environment. This control encompasses the initiation and operation of AWS resources, the ability to choose IP address ranges, establish network subnets, and configure routing tables and network gateways. Secure and convenient resource and application access within the VPC is facilitated through both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.

The term ‚ÄúRegion‚Äù refers to vast clusters of AWS data centers situated within specific territories. Multiple VPCs can be established within a single region, with each VPC differentiated by its unique IP address space range. The IPv4 address range is defined by selecting a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation, such as 10.0.0.0/16. Once created, the Amazon VPC address range remains immutable. These ranges can span from as extensive as /16 (equivalent to 65536 available addresses) to as limited as /28 (allowing for 16 available addresses). Crucially, these ranges must not overlap with any other connected networks.

The Amazon VPC service was introduced subsequent to the launch of Amazon EC2. Consequently, AWS provided two distinct networking platforms for a period: EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC. EC2-Classic established a single flat network where all Amazon EC2 instances operated, enabling shared connectivity among AWS clients. However, as of December 2013, AWS exclusively supports EC2-VPC. Each region includes a default VPC along with a default subnet featuring a CIDR block of 172.31.0.0/16.

#### 1.1.1. Subnets
A **subnet** is a segment of the IP address range that you use when provisioning your Amazon VPC. It directly provides the active network range to the AWS resources that may run within it, such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon RDS (Amazon Relational Database Service). Subnets are identified through CIDR blocks (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24 and 192.168.0.0/24), and the subnet‚Äôs CIDRs must be within the VPC‚Äôs CIDR. The smallest subnet that can be created is /28 (16 IP addresses). AWS reserves the first 4 IP addresses and the last 1 IP address of each subnet for intranet networking purposes. For example, a /28 subnet has 16 available IP addresses, but 5 reserved IPs are used for AWS, leaving 11 usable IP addresses for resources operating within this subnet.

An **Availability Zone (AZ)** is a single or multi-data center located within a Region and identified based on geographical location. Within an AZ, there can be one or more subnets. However, a subnet can only reside in a single AZ and cannot extend to other AZs.

Subnets are categorized as:
  - **Public subnet**: This subnet has a route table (discussed later) that directs traffic within the subnet to the VPC‚Äôs Internet Gateway (IGW) (discussed later).
  - **Private subnet**: The opposite of a Public subnet, it lacks a route table directing traffic to the VPC‚Äôs IGW.
  - **VPN-only subnet**: This subnet has a route table that directs traffic to Amazon VPC‚Äôs Virtual Private Gateway (VPG) (discussed later).

Regardless of the subnet type, the subnet‚Äôs internal IP address range is always private. This means that it is not possible to directly connect to addresses within this range from outside the Internet.

#### 1.1.2. Route Table
The **Route Table**, also referred to as the routing table, is responsible for providing routing instructions within a network and is associated with specific subnets.

For instance, in the scenario where a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is established with the network layer `10.10.0.0/16`, along with two subnets, `10.10.1.0/24` and `10.10.2.0/24`, each default subnet will be allocated a default route table.

Inside the route table, there will exist a route entry with the following details:

  - **Destination**: `10.10.0.0/16`
  - **Target**: `local`

This particular route entry signifies that resources created within the same VPC can communicate with each other.

#### 1.1.3.Internet Gateway
The **Internet Gateway (IGW)** is a crucial component of Amazon VPC that facilitates communication between resources within the VPC, specifically EC2 instances, and the Internet. The IGW exhibits robust horizontal scalability, along with high levels of redundancy and availability. It operates as a designated target within the Amazon VPC‚Äôs routing table, playing a vital role in directing traffic from EC2 instances to the external Internet. This process involves translating the network address of the EC2 instance into its corresponding Public IP address.

More precisely, the EC2 instances located within the VPC are only aware of their assigned Private IP addresses. However, when there is a need to transmit traffic from these EC2 instances to the Internet, the IGW intervenes by translating the originating Private IP address into the Public IP address (or Elastic IP addresses, as discussed later) assigned to the respective EC2 instance. This translation is upheld through a one-to-one mapping, which persists until the Public IP address is released.

Conversely, when the EC2 instances receive incoming traffic from the Internet, the IGW undertakes the task of translating the target address (Public IP address) into the corresponding Private IP address of the EC2 instance. Subsequently, the IGW forwards this traffic into the Amazon VPC.

#### 1.1.4. Gateway Endpoint
Gateway VPC endpoints provide reliable connectivity to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB without requiring an internet gateway or a NAT device for your VPC. Gateway endpoints do not use AWS PrivateLink, unlike other types of VPC endpoints.

Amazon S3 and DynamoDB support both gateway endpoints and interface endpoints. For a comparison of the options, see the following:
 - Types of VPC endpoints for Amazon S3
 - Types of VPC endpoints for Amazon DynamoDB
  
**Pricing**: There is no additional charge for using gateway endpoints.

You can access Amazon S3 and DynamoDB through their public service endpoints or through gateway endpoints. This overview compares these methods.

**Access through an internet gateway**

The following diagram shows how instances access Amazon S3 and DynamoDB through their public service endpoints. Traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB from an instance in a public subnet is routed to the internet gateway for the VPC and then to the service. Instances in a private subnet can't send traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB, because by definition private subnets do not have routes to an internet gateway. To enable instances in the private subnet to send traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB, you would add a NAT device to the public subnet and route traffic in the private subnet to the NAT device. While traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB traverses the internet gateway, it does not leave the AWS network.

**Access through a gateway endpoint**

The following diagram shows how instances access Amazon S3 and DynamoDB through a gateway endpoint. Traffic from your VPC to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB is routed to the gateway endpoint. Each subnet route table must have a route that sends traffic destined for the service to the gateway endpoint using the prefix list for the service. For more information, see AWS-managed prefix lists in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

**Routing**

When you create a gateway endpoint, you select the VPC route tables for the subnets that you enable. The following route is automatically added to each route table that you select. The destination is a prefix list for the service owned by AWS and the target is the gateway endpoint.

| **Destination** | **Target**  |
|:-----------:|:-------:|
| `prefix_list_id` | `gateway_endpoint_id` |



#### 1.1.5. Security Group
- Basic Features of Security Group
  - **Allow Rules Only**: Only Allow rules can be added; Deny rules cannot be added.
  - **Separate Rules for Traffic**: Separate rules can be specified for outgoing and incoming traffic.
  - **Initial Inbound Rules**: A newly created Security group starts with no Inbound rules. Initially, the instance won‚Äôt allow any traffic in, requiring the addition of an Inbound rule to enable access.
  - **Default Outbound Rule**: By default, the Security group includes an Outbound rule that permits all traffic to leave the instance. This rule can be modified or replaced with specific Outbound rules to control outgoing traffic originating from the instance. If there‚Äôs no Outbound rule, no traffic is allowed to exit the instance.
  - **Stateful Service**: Security groups are stateful services, meaning that if incoming traffic is allowed, outgoing traffic is automatically permitted, and vice versa, regardless of the Outbound rule.
  - **Instance Communication**: Instances can communicate only if they are associated with a Security group that permits connections, or if a Security group associated with the instance contains a rule allowing traffic. The default Security group has default rules allowing all traffic.
  - **Association with Network Interfaces**: Security groups are associated with network interfaces. After initialization, you can change the Security group assigned to an instance, which will also update the Security group for the corresponding primary network interface.

- Security Group Rule
  - A Security group rule is created to grant access to traffic entering or leaving an instance. This access can apply to a specific CIDR or to a Security group in the same VPC, or even to a Security group in another VPC connected by peering.

- Components of Security Group Rule
  - **Inbound Rules**: These include the source of the traffic and the destination port or port range. The source can be another security group, an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR range, or an IPv4/IPv6 address.
  - **Outbound Rules**: These include the destination of the traffic and the destination port or port range. The destination can be another security group, an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR range, an IPv4/IPv6 address, or a service identified by a prefix (e.g. igw_xxx) in the prefix ID list (where services are identified by the prefix ID - the name and ID of the available service in the region).
  - **Standard Protocols**: Each protocol has a standard protocol number associated with it. For instance, SSH is associated with port number 22.

### 1.2. Amazon S3
**Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)** is an object storage service that provides on-demand scalability, ensuring high levels of data availability, security, and performance. best.

S3 is built to meet the needs of customers of all sizes and industries who can use this service to store and protect any amount of data.

S3 can be used for many use cases such as dataware house, websites, mobile apps, backup and restore, storage, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and data analytics great. In addition, Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features, so you can organize your data and configure access controls to meet the specific requirements of your business, organization, and requirements. compliance requirements.

Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9‚Äôs) endurance and stores the data of millions of applications for companies worldwide.

### 1.3. Amazon EMR
### 1.4. Amazon EC2
 - **Amazon EC2** functions similarly to a conventional physical or virtual server, offering rapid initialization, robust resource scalability, and versatile flexibility.
 - **Virtual server**: Divides a physical server into multiple virtual servers to optimize resource utilization.
 - **Amazon EC2** supports a variety of workloads, including web hosting, applications, databases, authentication services, and other tasks typically handled by a standard server.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity within the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. Utilizing Amazon EC2 reduces hardware expenses, enabling faster application development and deployment. It empowers you to launch as many or as few virtual servers as needed, configure security and networking settings, and manage storage resources. Capacity can be increased (scale up) to manage compute-intensive tasks such as monthly or yearly processes or spikes in website traffic. Conversely, when usage subsides, capacity can be reduced (scale down).

The following diagram depicts a fundamental architecture of an Amazon EC2 instance deployed within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) within a specific Availability Zone in the Region. The EC2 instance‚Äôs security is governed by a security group, acting as a virtual firewall controlling inbound and outbound traffic. The instance employs a key pair‚Äîconsisting of a private key stored locally and a public key stored on the instance‚Äîto verify the user‚Äôs identity. In this setup, the instance is supported by an Amazon EBS volume.

Configuration of Amazon EC2 is obligatory, with configuration determined by the chosen EC2 instance types.

`Instance type` influences the following attributes:

 - CPU (Intel / AMD / ARM (Graviton 1/2/3) / GPU)
 - Memory
 - Network
 - Storage
  
`AMI` / `Backup` / `Key Pair`:
 - Employing **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)** enables the simultaneous provisioning of one or more **EC2 Instances**.
 - **AMI** options encompass those from AWS, AWS Marketplace, and custom AMIs created from existing **EC2 Instances**.
 - **AMI** includes **root OS volumes**; usage rights specify the associated AWS account, and **mapping EBS volumes** are assigned to EC2 Instances.
 - **EC2 instances** can be backed up via the creation of snapshots.
 - **Key pairs (public key and private key)** are employed to encrypt login information for **EC2 Instances**.

**Amazon EC2** offers the following `prominent features`:
 - Virtual servers.
 - Preconfigured templates for your instances containing necessary components like the operating system and additional software.
 - Various configurations including CPU, memory, storage, networking capacity, and graphics hardware for your instances.
 - Secure login credentials for your instances. AWS retains the public key while you keep the private key in a secure location.
 - Storage volumes for temporary data that gets deleted upon instance stoppage, hibernation, or termination.
 - Persistent storage volumes for your data utilizing Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS).
 - Multiple physical locations accommodating your resources such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes.
 - A virtual firewall permitting you to define protocols, ports, source IP ranges that can access your instances, and destination IP ranges your instances can connect to.
 - Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing.
 - Metadata that you can generate and assign to your Amazon EC2 resources.
 - Virtual networks that you can establish, offering logical isolation from the wider AWS Cloud. Optionally, these virtual networks can be linked to your own network.

On the search bar, enter the keyword CloudFormation, then click `CloudFormation` Service.
![image](./1v.png)

Next we click `Create Stack`
![image](./2v.png)

In the `Create Stack` interface, select `existing template`, then select `upload template`, continue to click `choose file` to select the file, after uploading the correct file you want, click `Next`.
![image](./3v.png)

Enter the `Stack name` and select `Instance type`.
![image](./4v.png)

Select the previously created `Key Pair`.
![image](./5v.png)

C√°c th√¥ng s·ªë kh√°c ta ƒë·ªÉ nguy√™n v√† b·∫•m `Next`.
![image](./6v.png)

Continue clicking `Next` and finally click `Submit`.
![image](./7v.png)
![image](./8v.png)

We can see the `Services` and `features` being initialized according to the template we specified, we can click on the refresh icon to update the status.
![image](./9v.png)

Now the `Stack` has been created successfully.
![image](./10v.png)

### 5.2. Manual Setup
#### 5.2.1. Create S3 Bucket
First we need to select `Region`, Here I choose `Singapore`
![image](./set_region.png)

We search for the `S3` service in the search bar, then click on `S3`
![image](./ETLELT - Project.png)

After entering the `S3` service, click `Create Bucket`
![image](./(1).png)

Next we enter the `bucket name`
![image](./(2).png)

Enable `Bucket Versioning`
![image](./(3).png)

Finally, click `Create Bucket` to initialize the bucket
![image](./(4).png)

After completing the above operations, we will create a bucket in the region Singapore (ap-southeast-1)
![image](./(5).png)

#### 5.2.2. Upload Resources
Click on the previously created bucket, then select `Create folder`
![image](./(6).png)

In the `Folder name` field, fill in `logs`, specify the encryption key for the folder, then click `Create folder`
![image](./(7).png)
{{< admonition note "Why do we need to create a logs folder?" >}}
EMR Cluster needs a path to a location in S3 to perform logging for cluster activities such as tasks, nodes,...
{{< /admonition >}}

We do the same with the `input`, `output` and `scripts` folders
![image](./(8).png)
![image](./(9).png)
![image](./(10).png)

After completion, we have 4 folders as below
![image](./(11).png)

In the `input` folder, we upload input data for `EMR Cluster`, first click `upload`
![image](./(12).png)

then select `add files`
![image](./(13).png)

then select the data file downloaded from the link above
![image](./(14).png)

After confirming that we have added the correct data file, we select `upload`
![image](./(15).png)

We do the same with the `scripts` folder, this folder will contain code that helps `transform` and `calculate` according to the needs and purposes of data use.
![image](./(16).png)

In addition, the `output` folder is used to contain cluster output data

#### 5.2.3. Create VPC
In the search bar, search for the keyword `VPC`, then click on `VPC service`.

In the VPC console, click `Create VPC`.
![image](./1.png)

Choose `VPC and More`, enter a name for the VPC in the `Auto-generate` field, next fill in the `IPv4 CIDR block` with the value `10.10.0.0/16`
![image](./2.png)

Next we choose the `AZ` number as 1, the `Public Subnet` number as 1, the `Private Subnet` number as 0,Then we choose `S3 Gateway` so that the `Cluster` can `communicate` with `S3 Bucket` via the internal network
![image](./3.png)

Finally, click Create VPC
![image](./4.png)

Below are the `features` built with `VPC`
![image](./5.png)

##### 5.2.3.1. Subnets
We can see that the `VPC` was created with a `Public Subnet` in `AZ` `ap-southeast-1a` with an `IPv4 CIDR` of `10.10.0.0/20`
![image](./6.png)
![image](./7.png)

Detailed parameters of `Public Subnet`
![image](./8.png)

##### 5.2.3.2. Route Table
We can see that in addition to the `default route`, we have a route with `Destination` of `0.0.0.0/0` and `Target` of `Internet Gateway ID`, allowing services located in the Public Subnet to go out to the Internet.
![image](./9.png)

`Public Subnet` and `Route Table` are `associated` with each other, helping to specify routes for the public subnet
![image](./10.png)

##### 5.2.3.3. Internet Gateway
The `Internet Gateway` is created and `attached` to the `VPC` we created above and `routed` in the `route table`
![image](./11.png)

##### 5.2.3.4. VpcEnpoint
We can see that a `VpcEndpoint` is created under the `VPC` we created above with the `S3` service and the `Endpoint Type` is of type `Gateway`, this helps the `EMR Cluster` to communicate with the `S3 Bucket` through the internal network.
![image](./12.png)

##### 5.2.3.5. Security Group
A `Security Group` is created belonging to the `VPC` we created above
![image](./13.png)

We can see that `Inbound rules` and `Outbound rules` allow `All traffic` to enter and exit
![image](./14.png)
![image](./15.png)

{{< admonition warning >}}
`Inbound` and `Outbound` are configured with `All traffic` which is not a security issue, which we need to consider and handle.
{{< /admonition >}}

#### 5.2.4. Create KeyPair
In EC2 Console choose `Key pair`
![image](./1q.png)

Next, click `Create Key pair`
![image](./2q.png)

Enter the `Key pair name`, then click `Create Key pair`.
![image](./3q.png)

We get a new `key pair`.
![image](./4q.png)

#### 5.2.5. Create and Add Roles
We will create `Roles` using `CLI`, first we need to `export environment variables`.
```Bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=KJFKLSJJFKSLDJSLDJK
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=SHJKLSDKF+KSJDFKJSLDKJF+SJKS+LKSJLK
```

We run the following command to start creating EMR Roles.
```bash
aws emr create-default-roles
```
Run the command below to check the roles that have been created.
```bash
aws iam list-roles | grep 'EMR_DefaultRole\ | EMR_EC2_DefaultRole'
```

We will check again in `Amazon IAM` to make sure the roles have been created.
In IAM console, choose Roles
![image](./1z.png)

We see that the necessary Roles have been created.
![image](./2z.png)


#### 5.2.6. Create EMR Cluster
On the search bar, search with the keyword `EMR`, then click `EMR service`
![image](./long.png)

In the `EMR` console, select `Create cluster`
![image](./2s.png)

First we enter a name for the `cluster`, next we select the latest `EMR Release` (currently `emr-7.2.0`), then we select Application (`Spark`).
![image](./3s.png)

We select `Amazon Linux release`, automatically applying the latest updated version.
![image](./4s.png)

Choose `Instance Type` for `Master Node`
![image](./5s.png)

Next we choose `Instance Type` for `Worker Node` including 1 `core` and 1 `task`
![image](./6s.png)

Set the number of `cores` and `tasks`, here we leave 1 core and 1 task, then we choose `VPC` and `Subnet` for `EMR Cluster`.
![image](./7s.png)

We select the `VPC` and `Subnet` that were previously created for the `cluster`.
![image](./8s.png)
![image](./9s.png)

We specify the path to the `logs` directory in the `s3 bucket` for the `cluster`.
![image](./10s.png)

Choose the `keypair` for the `cluster` we created above
![image](./11s.png)

Specify the `Service Role` and `EC2 Instance profile` that we created and added above
![image](./12s.png)
![image](./13s.png)

Confirm the information and click `Create Cluster`.
![image](./14s.png)

At this point, the `Cluster` will be in `Starting` state, after a few minutes it will switch to `waiting` state (At this point it is ready to receive jobs and tasks)
![image](./15s.png)
![image](./16s.png)

## 6. üë∑ Submit Work to EMR Cluster
When the `Cluster` is in the `Waiting` state, we will perform `Submit work` for the `EMR Cluster` by clicking on the `Steps` tab.
![image](./ww.png)


Next we choose `Add step`.
![image](./2w.png)

In the `Type` section, select `Spark application`, in the `Name` field, fill in the `step name`, and `Deploy mode`, select `Cluster mode`.
![image](./3w.png)

In `Application location`, point to the folder containing the `PySpark script` containing the calculation and data conversion logic. In the `Arguments` section, fill in the following arguments:

```bash
--data-source s3://online-retail-ecommerce/input/OnlineRetail.csv 
--output-uri s3://online-retail-ecommerce/output/
```

In `step action` we choose `continue`.
Finally we click `Add step`.
![image](./4w.png)

After creating the `step`, it will now have a `Pending` status. You can click `Refresh table` to update the step's status.
![image](./5w.png)

After 20 to 25 seconds, the step has moved to the `Running` state, which means the `EMR Cluster` is performing tasks.
![image](./6w.png)

After 50 seconds, the step has moved to the `Completed` state, which means the `EMR Cluster` has completed its assigned work.
![image](./7w.png)

## 7. üîé View Results
### 7.1. View Output
After `EMR Cluster` completes its work, we can move to the `output` folder to see the output results.
![image](./8w.png)

{{< admonition >}}
The output data is divided into multiple files while the input is only 1 file. This is because Spark automatically splits the data to perform parallel calculations and processing, helping to increase performance when working with data. big material.
{{< /admonition >}}

### 7.2. View Data
To check if the data has actually been processed, you can download one of the files in the output folder, by checking the file you want to download and clicking download. After downloading you can view the data. This is before and after the data is processed.
![image](./data-2.png)
![image](./data-1.png)

### 7.2. View Logs
We have specified the `Logs` location for `EMR Cluster`, so it will perform Logs during data processing.
![image](./9w.png)

## 8. üóë Clean Up
### 8.1. Terminate EMR CLuster
In the `EMR Console`, we select the cluster to terminate, then we click `Terminate`.
![image](./10w.png)
![image](./11w.png)

The cluster is now in `Terminating` state.
![image](./12w.png)


The status changes to `Terminated`, meaning the cluster has successfully terminated.
![image](./1t.png)

### 8.2. Delete VPC
Trong Tab `Your VPCs` ta ch·ªçn `VPC` c·∫ßn x√≥a, sau ƒë√≥ ch·ªçn `Delete VPC`.
![image](./2t.png)

We can see that when we delete a `VPC`, the `features` created with it will also be deleted, this helps clean up resources faster, features include `Internet Gateway`, `Route Table`, `Security Group`, `Subnet`, `VpcEnpoint`. Then we enter `delete` to confirm deleting the VPC, finally click `Delete`.
![image](./3t.png)

### 8.3. Delete S3 Bucket
Select the `Bucket` you want to delete, then click `Empty` to delete the bucket's contents.
![image](./4t.png)

Enter `permanently delete` to confirm deletion of the content, then click `Empty`.
![image](./5t.png)

We re-select the `Bucket` that just deleted its contents and click `Delete`.
![image](./6t.png)

Enter the `bucket name` to confirm deletion then click `Delete bucket`.
![image](./7t.png)

## 1 Requirements

Thanks to the simplicity of Hugo, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is the only dependency of this theme.

Just install latest version of [:(fa-regular fa-file-archive fa-fw): Hugo (> 0.110.0)](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) for your OS (**Windows**, **Linux**, **macOS**).

{{< admonition note "Why not support earlier versions of Hugo?" >}}
Since [Markdown Render Hooks](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup#markdown-render-hooks) were introduced in [Hugo Christmas Edition](https://gohugo.io/news/0.62.0-relnotes/), and some image sources are using webp which was introduced in [0.84.0](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.84.0) and also we changed [config.toml to hugo.toml](https://github.com/khusika/FeelIt/commit/f965cb91df2b2e90e667e3cf152fffd73d885906), this theme only supports Hugo versions above **0.110.0**.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition tip "Hugo extended version is recommended" >}}
Since some features of this theme need to processes :(fa-brands fa-sass fa-fw): SCSS to :(fa-brands fa-css3 fa-fw): CSS, it is recommended to use Hugo **extended** version for better experience.
{{< /admonition >}}

## 2 Installation

The following steps are here to help you initialize your new website. If you don‚Äôt know Hugo at all, we strongly suggest you learn more about it by following this [great documentation for beginners](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

### 2.1 Create Your Project

Hugo provides a `new` command to create a new website:

```bash
hugo new site my_website
cd my_website
```

### 2.2 Install the Theme

The **FeelIt** theme‚Äôs repository is: [https://github.com/khusika/FeelIt](https://github.com/khusika/FeelIt).

You can download the [latest release :(fa-regular fa-file-archive fa-fw): .zip file](https://github.com/khusika/FeelIt/releases) of the theme and extract it in the `themes` directory.

Alternatively, clone this repository to the `themes` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khusika/FeelIt.git themes/FeelIt
```

Or, create an empty git repository and make this repository a submodule of your site directory:

```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/khusika/FeelIt.git themes/FeelIt
```

### 2.3 Basic Configuration {#basic-configuration}

The following is a basic configuration for the FeelIt theme:

```toml
baseURL = "http://example.org/"
# [en, zh-cn, fr, ...] determines default content language
defaultContentLanguage = "en"
# language code
languageCode = "en"
title = "My New Hugo Site"

# Change the default theme to be use when building the site with Hugo
theme = "FeelIt"

[params]
  # FeelIt theme version
  version = "1.0.X"

[menu]
  [[menu.main]]
    identifier = "posts"
    # you can add extra information before the name (HTML format is supported), such as icons
    pre = ""
    # you can add extra information after the name (HTML format is supported), such as icons
    post = ""
    name = "Posts"
    url = "/posts/"
    # title will be shown when you hover on this menu link
    title = ""
    weight = 1
  [[menu.main]]
    identifier = "tags"
    pre = ""
    post = ""
    name = "Tags"
    url = "/tags/"
    title = ""
    weight = 2
  [[menu.main]]
    identifier = "categories"
    pre = ""
    post = ""
    name = "Categories"
    url = "/categories/"
    title = ""
    weight = 3

# Markup related configuration in Hugo
[markup]
  # Syntax Highlighting (https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting)
  [markup.highlight]
    # false is a necessary configuration (https://github.com/khusika/FeelIt/issues/158)
    noClasses = false
```

{{< admonition >}}
When building the website, you can set a theme by using `--theme` option. However, we suggest you modify the configuration file (**hugo.toml**) and set the theme as the default.
{{< /admonition >}}

### 2.4 Create Your First Post

Here is the way to create your first post:

```bash
hugo new posts/first_post.md
```

Feel free to edit the post file by adding some sample content and replacing the title value in the beginning of the file.

{{< admonition >}}
By default all posts and pages are created as a draft. If you want to render these pages, remove the property `draft: true` from the metadata, set the property `draft: false` or add `-D`/`--buildDrafts` parameter to `hugo` command.
{{< /admonition >}}

### 2.5 Launching the Website Locally

Launch by using the following command:

```bash
hugo serve
```

Go to `http://localhost:1313`.

![Basic configuration preview](basic-configuration-preview.png "Basic configuration preview")

{{< admonition tip >}}
When you run `hugo serve`, when the contents of the files change, the page automatically refreshes with the changes.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition >}}
Since the theme use `.Scratch` in Hugo to implement some features,
it is highly recommended that you add `--disableFastRender` parameter to `hugo server` command for the live preview of the page you are editing.

```bash
hugo serve --disableFastRender
```
{{< /admonition >}}

### 2.6 Build the Website

When your site is ready to deploy, run the following command:

```bash
hugo
```

A `public` folder will be generated, containing all static content and assets for your website. It can now be deployed on any web server.

{{< admonition tip >}}
The website can be automatically published and hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (Read more about [Automated HUGO deployments with Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2015/07/30/hosting-hugo-on-netlifyinsanely-fast-deploys/)).
Alternatively, you can use [AWS Amplify](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-aws-amplify/), [Github pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/), [Render](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-render/) and more...
{{< /admonition >}}

## 3 Configuration

### 3.1 Site Configuration {#site-configuration}

In addition to [Hugo global configuration](https://gohugo.io/overview/configuration/) and [menu configuration](#basic-configuration), **FeelIt** lets you define the following parameters in your site configuration (here is a `hugo.toml`, whose values are default).

Please open the code block below to view the complete sample configuration :(fa-regular fa-hand-point-down fa-fw)::

```toml
[params]
  # {{< version 0.2.0 changed >}} FeelIt theme version
  version = "1.0.X"
  # site description
  description = "This is My New Hugo Site"
  # site keywords
  keywords = ["Theme", "Hugo"]
  # site default theme ("light", "dark", "auto")
  defaultTheme = "auto"
  # public git repo url only then enableGitInfo is true
  gitRepo = ""

{{< admonition note "Hugo environments" >}}
Default environments are `development` with `hugo serve` and `production` with `hugo`.

Due to limitations in the local `development` environment,
the **comment system**, **CDN**, **fingerprint** and **PWA** will not be enabled in the `development` environment.

You could enable these features with `hugo serve -e production`.

The default CDN data file is located in `themes/FeelIt/assets/data/cdn/` directory.
You can store your own data file in the same path under your project: `assets/data/cdn/`.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition tip "Tips about social Configuration" >}}
{{< version 0.2.0 >}}

You can directly set your ID to get a default social link and its icon:

```toml
[params.social]
  Mastodon = "@xxxx"
```

The social link generated is `https://mastodon.technology/@xxxx`.

Or You can set more options through a dict:

```toml
[params.social]
  [params.social.Mastodon]
    # weight when arranging icons (the greater the weight, the later the icon is positioned)
    weight = 0
    # your social ID
    id = "@xxxx"
    # prefix of your social link
    prefix = "https://mastodon.social/"
    # content hovering on the icon
    title = "Mastodon"
```

The default data of all supported social links is located in `themes/FeelIt/assets/data/social.yaml`,
which is you can refer to.

### 3.2 Favicons, Browserconfig, Manifest

It is recommended to put your own favicons:

* apple-touch-icon.png (180x180)
* favicon-32x32.png (32x32)
* favicon-16x16.png (16x16)
* mstile-150x150.png (150x150)
* android-chrome-192x192.png (192x192)
* android-chrome-512x512.png (512x512)

into `/static`. They‚Äôre easily created via [https://realfavicongenerator.net/](https://realfavicongenerator.net/).

Customize `browserconfig.xml` and `site.webmanifest` to set theme-color and background-color.

### 3.3 Style Customization

{{< version 0.2.8 changed >}}

{{< admonition >}}
Hugo **extended** version is necessary for the style customization.
{{< /admonition >}}

**FeelIt** theme has been built to be as configurable as possible by defining custom `.scss` style files.

The directory including the custom `.scss` style files is `assets/css` relative to **your project root directory**.

In `assets/css/_override.scss`, you can override the variables in `themes/FeelIt/assets/css/_variables.scss` to customize the style.

Here is a example:

```scss
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fira+Mono:400,700&display=swap&subset=latin-ext');
$code-font-family: Fira Mono, Source Code Pro, Menlo, Consolas, Monaco, monospace;
```

In `assets/css/_custom.scss`, you can add some css style code to customize the style.

## 4 Multilingual and i18n

**FeelIt** theme is fully compatible with Hugo multilingual mode, which provides in-browser language switching.

### 4.2 Basic Configuration

After learning [how Hugo handle multilingual websites](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual), define your languages in your [site configuration](#site-configuration).

For example with English, Chinese and French website:

```toml
# [en, zh-cn, fr, pl, ...] determines default content language
defaultContentLanguage = "en"

[languages]
  [languages.en]
    weight = 1
    title = "My New Hugo Site"
    languageCode = "en"
    languageName = "English"
    [[languages.en.menu.main]]
      identifier = "posts"
      pre = ""
      post = ""
      name = "Posts"
      url = "/posts/"
      title = ""
      weight = 1
    [[languages.en.menu.main]]
      identifier = "tags"
      pre = ""
      post = ""
      name = "Tags"
      url = "/tags/"
      title = ""
      weight = 2
    [[languages.en.menu.main]]
      identifier = "categories"
      pre = ""
      post = ""
      name = "Categories"
      url = "/categories/"
      title = ""
      weight = 3

  [languages.zh-cn]
    weight = 2
    title = "ÊàëÁöÑÂÖ®Êñ∞ Hugo ÁΩëÁ´ô"
    # language code, CN only here
    languageCode = "zh-CN"
    languageName = "ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá"
    # whether to include Chinese/Japanese/Korean
    hasCJKLanguage = true
    [[languages.zh-cn.menu.main]]
      identifier = "posts"
      pre = ""
      post = ""
      name = "ÊñáÁ´†"
      url = "/posts/"
      title = ""
      weight = 1
    [[languages.zh-cn.menu.main]]
      identifier = "tags"
      pre = ""
      post = ""
      name = "Ê†áÁ≠æ"
      url = "/tags/"
      title = ""
      weight = 2
    [[languages.zh-cn.menu.main]]
      identifier = "categories"
      pre = ""
      post = ""
      name = "ÂàÜÁ±ª"
      url = "/categories/"
      title = ""
      weight = 3

  [languages.fr]
    weight = 3
    title = "Mon nouveau site Hugo"
    languageCode = "fr"
    languageName = "Fran√ßais"
    [[languages.fr.menu.main]]
      identifier = "posts"
      pre = ""
      post = ""
      name = "Postes"
      url = "/posts/"
      title = ""
      weight = 1
    [[languages.fr.menu.main]]
      identifier = "tags"
      pre = ""
      post = ""
      name = "Balises"
      url = "/tags/"
      title = ""
      weight = 2
    [[languages.fr.menu.main]]
      identifier = "categories"
      name = "Cat√©gories"
      pre = ""
      post = ""
      url = "/categories/"
      title = ""
      weight = 3
```

Then, for each new page, append the language code to the file name.

Single file `my-page.md` is split in three files:

* in English: `my-page.en.md`
* in Chinese: `my-page.zh-cn.md`
* in French: `my-page.fr.md`
* in Ukrainian: `my-page.uk.md`

{{< admonition >}}
Be aware that only translated pages are displayed in menu. It‚Äôs not replaced with default language content.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition tip >}}
Use [Front Matter parameter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual#translate-your-content) to translate urls too.
{{< /admonition >}}

### 4.3 Overwrite Translation Strings

Translations strings are used for common default values used in the theme. Translations are available in [some languages](#language-compatibility), but you may use another language or want to override default values.

To override these values, create a new file in your local i18n folder `i18n/<languageCode>.toml` and inspire yourself from `themes/FeelIt/i18n/en.toml`.

By the way, as these translations could be used by other people, please take the time to propose a translation by [:(fa-solid fa-code-branch fa-fw): making a PR](https://github.com/khusika/FeelIt/pulls) to the theme!

## 5 Search

{{< version 0.2.0 >}}

Based on [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) or [algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), searching is supported in **FeelIt** theme.

### 5.1 Output Configuration

In order to generate `index.json` for searching, add `JSON` output file type to the `home` of the `outputs` part in your [site configuration](#site-configuration).

```toml
[outputs]
  home = ["HTML", "RSS", "JSON"]
```

### 5.2 Search Configuration

Based on `index.json` generated by Hugo, you could activate searching.

Here is the search configuration in your [site configuration](#site-configuration):

```toml
[params.search]
  enable = true
  # type of search engine ("lunr", "algolia")
  type = "lunr"
  # max index length of the chunked content
  contentLength = 4000
  # placeholder of the search bar
  placeholder = ""
  # {{< version 0.2.1 >}} max number of results length
  maxResultLength = 10
  # {{< version 0.2.3 >}} snippet length of the result
  snippetLength = 30
  # {{< version 0.2.1 >}} HTML tag name of the highlight part in results
  highlightTag = "em"
  # {{< version 0.2.4 >}} whether to use the absolute URL based on the baseURL in search index
  absoluteURL = false
  [params.search.algolia]
    index = ""
    appID = ""
    searchKey = ""
```

{{< admonition note "How to choose search engine?" >}}
The following is a comparison of two search engines:

* `lunr`: simple, no need to synchronize `index.json`, no limit for `contentLength`,
  but high bandwidth and low performance (Especially for Chinese which needs a large segmentit library)
* `algolia`: high performance and low bandwidth, but need to synchronize `index.json` and limit for `contentLength`

{{< version 0.2.3 >}} The content of the post is separated by `h2` and `h3` HTML tag to improve query performance and basically implement full-text search.
`contentLength` is used to limit the max index length of the part starting with `h2` and `h3` HTML tag.
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition tip "Tips about algolia" >}}
You need to upload `index.json` files to algolia to activate searching.
You could upload the `index.json` files by browsers but a CLI tool may be better.
[Algolia Atomic](https://github.com/chrisdmacrae/atomic-algolia) is a good choice.
To be compatible with Hugo multilingual mode,
you need to upload different `index.json` for each language to the different index of algolia, such as `zh-cn/index.json` or `fr/index.json`...
